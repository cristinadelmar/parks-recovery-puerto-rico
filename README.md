# No Park to Go
## Project 1

This is my submission for the LEDE Program’s first project – that includes a simple analysis in pandas and a couple of DataWrapper graphics. 

I wanted to look at the recovery from Hurricane María process in Puerto Rico, specifically to the projects related to the rebuilding on parks and recreational facilities. 

After collecting the data, I looked for the projects that included the community center and the park from the community where I grew up, in the municipality of Caguas. I found for none of them money has been disbursed. I looked at other projects in all Puerto Rico, and the case is similar for most of them. 

Almost six years after Hurricane María, most of the parks and recreational facilities that were damaged in Puerto Rico remains without the proper fixing without money being disbursed for this purpose. Only 15% of the projects have funds disbursed. 

## Data Collection Process

I downloaded data from the Puerto Rico Disaster Recovery Transparency Portal, an official portal of the Government of Puerto Rico, managed by the Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resiliency. This portal has data about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds obligations to repair all the public infrastructure that was damaged as a consequence of the hurricane. I specifically looked for all the parks and recreational infrastructure own and managed by the municipalities. It includes the cultural center and the park located in the community where I grew up in the neighborhood of Santa Juana, in the town of Caguas. 

## Data Analysis Process

After collecting the data, I used pandas to clean it and to answer the questions I had about the status of the reparation of all the infrastructure categorized as a park, recreational facility or related. 

Here is the CSV file:

•	Obligated projects by FEMA for parks and recreational facilities

I summed all the funds obligated and the amount that has been disbursed. I obtained a percentage.

I also obtained the amount of projects for which the amount disbursed is 0 (868) and what percentage it represents in the total amount of projects with money obligated. 

Then. I wanted to see what was the obligated and disbursed amount for municipalities and to see which one had the biggest percentage of money disbursed from its total obligated. I found out my municipality of Caguas is in the 48th position in a list of 78 municipalities.

## Skills learned

I learned to start and finish a whole project, even when it meant to scale down from my original idea.

Also, when working with pandas, I was able to find out to perform some tasks necessary for the data analysis, like eliminating the older versions of the projects to be able to only count the most recent version of each one. 

## Things I would’ve liked to do

I wanted to visualize how many days have passed since the day the funds for each project was obligated until the data was updated and have a median an average for it. I would have liked to be able to say, “at the current rhythm of disbursement, it would take X years for the full recovery of Puerto Rico from Hurricane María”.
