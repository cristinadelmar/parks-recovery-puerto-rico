            <p class="intro"><i>Almost 6 years after Hurricane María struck the island of Puerto Rico, my community of Santa Juana, in the center-eastern town of Caguas, still waits for the reparation of its cultural center and its park. Is not an extraordinary case. There are 2006 reconstruction projects with obligated funds, but for most of them, money has not been disbursed. </i></p> 
            <div class="body-text sub-font"> 
                <p>The cultural center and park of Santa Juana, the community where I grew up, in the town of Caguas, in the central east of Puerto Rico, have been closed for almost six years. First, they were closed when Hurricane Irma impacted the island, on September 6, 2017. The lack of electricity paused the celebration of weddings, quinceañeros, neighborhood gatherings and other activities that were held there.</p>
                <p>When electricity service had barely returned, two weeks later, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane María did even more damage. Not just in Santa Juana, a working-class neighborhood with about 700 houses, but throughout the Puerto Rican archipielago.</p> 
                <p>According to the <a href=https://recovery.pr.gov/en>Puerto Rico Disaster Recovery Transparency Portal</a>, the community center and the Santa Juana Park are two projects for which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) obligated $448,588 and $247,631, respectively. However, the amount that has been disbursed for repair is $0.</p>
                <p>A look at the universe of recovery projects for parks and recreational facilities damaged by Hurricane Maria shows that the projects in my community represent the norm and not the exception in terms of how the recovery process is going throughout the communities of Puerto Rico.</p> 
                <iframe title="A long way to full disbursement" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-2jCRs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2jCRs/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="163" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                </script>
                <p>There is a total of 2005 projects for parks and recreational facilities. Of these, 868 have $0 as the amount disbursed.</p>
                <p>In Caguas, my hometown, there are 45 undergoing projects of parks and recreational facilities. But only for eight of them some money has been disbursed.</p>
                <p>When look at the municipalities, there are a few that have managed to get most of their obligated funds. But for most of them, the disbursements have been less than half of what has been obligated.</p>

                <p>In Santa Juana, the winds blew away part of the roof of the center and the water that entered damaged its entire interior. Today, it is possible to see the sky from between the cement walls that withstood the storm because of the hole that was left there. In the park, the gates collapsed, the swings broke, and the children of my community no longer had a safe place to practice and play their basketball and baseball games.</p>    
                <p>Like it happens in Santa Juana, throughout the island, there are hundreds of community centers, baseball parks, basketball courts and other recreational facilities waiting to be repaired. Almost six years have passed.</p>
